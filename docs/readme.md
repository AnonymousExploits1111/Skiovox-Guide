# How to use the Skiovox Exploit

## What is Skiovox?
Skiovox is an exploit that allows you to get an unblocked browser on your **School** Chromebook that has no school installed extentions, no blocked pages, and lets you install any extention you want.

## How to use it
- Make sure your chromebook has kiosk apps or else this will not work
  
(when signed out)
![Kiosk app example](https://github.com/AnonymousExploits1111/Skiovox-Guide/blob/1fcbf6d1f81b2080e12b6c14f1c31a37bd4740b7/docs/Kiosk_app_example.jpg?raw=true)

1. Sign out
2. Turn off your wifi
3. Click on Kiosk apps
4. (Get ready to press Alt + Shift + S Quickly, you should read the next step first) Press any kiosk app (I prefer NWEA, TestNav, and SecureTestBrowser but it doesn't matter which one usually, if it doesn't work try another)
5. Immediately after you press an app, Quickly press Alt + Shift + S (if you spam it it might not work)
